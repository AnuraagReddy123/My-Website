      <p>
        This project is a simple social media dashboard application with user registration, login,
        and the ability to create, view, edit, and delete posts. The application uses Node.js for
        the server-side logic, Express.js for routing, MongoDB for data storage, and JWT for
        authentication.

        This website has been created as an attempt to tackle the problem of Climate Action which is
        a part of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The website is intended to be used
        by general people where they will be provided with ways in which they can save money while
        also indirectly saving the environment. This will also create awareness of different ways to
        save the environment.

          Implementing an SVM from scratch

      <p>Tech Stack: Jupyter, Python</p>
      <p>
        SVMs are widely used in a lot of applications in machine learning. They are quick and
        versatile, making them a staple in machine learning. However the internal working of an SVM
        is not so straightforward. Here I implemented an SVM from scratch, implementing the
        Lagrangian equation and also implemented the kernel trick in the code

          A comparison between ARIMA and Deep Learning Models for Forecasting
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>Tech Stack: Python, Pytorch, LSTM, CNN</p>
      <p>
        In this project, motivated by the rapid rise of deep learning techniques, I conducted a
        comprehensive comparison of traditional statistical models like ARIMA against modern deep
        learning models (LSTM, CNN) for time series forecasting. The main goal was to assess if
        classical models like ARIMA could still hold their ground against the cutting-edge deep
        learning architectures. This project provided valuable insights into the relative strengths
        and limitations of different forecasting techniques across various time series scenarios.

          Sentiment Analysis of Reddit Travel Data
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, BERT, spaCy</p>
      <p>
        I worked in a team to conduct sentiment analysis on the r/travel subreddit using
        Huggingface’s Reddit dataset, focusing on pre-Covid and during-Covid periods. After
        preprocessing the dataset, implementing spaCy’s lemmatization and resolving name variations
        for data quality and coherence, we applied the RoBERTa model for sentiment analysis and
        BERTopic for topic modeling, revealing insights into global travel patterns and sentiment
        shifts.

        I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game using reinforcement learning techniques in python and
        programmed three distinct AI opponents, each employing its unique learning approaches:
        Value-based iteration, policy-based iteration, and Q-learning and trained and assessed these
        agents in playing Tic-Tac-Toe against human opponents.

      <p>Tech Stack: Python, MIPS</p>
      <p>
        I worked in a team to build a simulator for MIPS language to better understand assembly
        instructions and the instruction pipeline in computer architecture. We designed and
        implemented a pipeline structure and simulated a set of instructions for MIPS. We also
        implemented an LRU cache to see how it affects the number of stalls and cycles per
        instructions.

      <p>
        I worked on a team to design a new C-like language called NHAN, for which we built a
        compiler using C. It supported arrays, functions and recursive functions. It used an
        Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) as an intermediate representation and generated MIPS code as its
        output. This MIPS code could be run on qtSpim to generate output.

        editor for the FreeBSD kernel and Implemented statistical analysis, including average marks
        and highest/lowest marks. In addition we designed features for dynamic user and faculty
        management, supporting different users at the operating system level. (Admin, Students,
        Faculty) and utilized file operations to read and write data.
